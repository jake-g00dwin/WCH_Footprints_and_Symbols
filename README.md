# WCH_Footprints_and_Symbols
A KiCAD library for WCH chips.


Mostly going to work on getting all the RISC-V based MCUs added, then I'll 
start working on the other ICs.

This library is for the newer versions of KiCAD and will make use of the
alternate pin functions where possible.

On the subject of the footprints, they are the same as the default library
ones. I've added them to the repo just in case someone is missing them.
